## üìñ Key Terminology

### NLP Techniques Explained:

**Sentiment Analysis (VADER)**
- Determines emotional tone (positive, negative, neutral)
- Compound score: -1 (very negative) to +1 (very positive)
- Applied to: open-ended text responses

**LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)**
- Topic modeling technique
- Discovers hidden themes in text collection
- Outputs: topics with associated keywords

**LSA (Latent Semantic Analysis)**
- Semantic theme extraction
- Uses TF-IDF and dimensionality reduction (SVD)
- Reveals underlying concepts in text

**K-Means Clustering**
- User segmentation technique
- Groups users with similar characteristics
- Based on: AI usage, pain points, willingness to pay, trust levels

**TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**
- Measures word importance in documents
- Higher score = more important/distinctive word
- Used in: topic modeling, text analysis

**RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**
- AI architecture that retrieves relevant documents before generating response
- Grounds AI outputs in actual sources
- Provides verifiable citations

**Domain Adaptation**
- Fine-tuning AI model on specific domain (e.g., Kenyan law)
- Improves accuracy and relevance for specialized tasks
- vs. Generic models: trained on broad, global data

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Issue: UnicodeEncodeError
**Solution:** Already fixed in pipeline (emojis and special characters removed)

### Issue: NLTK data not found
**Solution:** Pipeline auto-downloads required data. If fails, manually run:
```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('vader_lexicon')
```

### Issue: Module not found
**Solution:** Install missing package:
```bash
pip install [package_name]
```

### Issue: CSV file not found
**Solution:** Check CSV_PATH in line 888 of `legal_survey_nlp_pipeline.py`
- Ensure full absolute path is correct
- Use raw string: `r"c:\path\to\file.csv"`

### Issue: Empty output or errors
**Solution:** Check CSV format:
- Column names must match survey questions
- At least 3 responses recommended for topic modeling
- No completely empty columns
